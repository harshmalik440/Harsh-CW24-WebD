# Harsh-CW24-WebD
This project contains contains the Task 1 of the IITG Coding Club's CODEWEEK'24 Web Development module.
I wasn't able to complete Task 2 entirely but I have added some of the features to be done in Task 2 and made the site functionable to a small extent. Some features include :-
1. Making the navigation bar hoverable and functionable. Try clicking any of the tab in the nav. bar like news, world, politics, etc.
2. Making the bigger articles in the middle hoverable.
3. Making the sidebar with smaller articles hoverable as well as functionable. Try clicking on the content of those articles.

Also, I have hosted the website on the Internet. You can view it using this link: https://harshmalik440.github.io/Harsh-CW24-WebD/
